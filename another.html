<h1> Freshness </h1>
<p class="blocktext">
	Freshness is the sweet smell of nature and clean linen that is created by the manmade element Febreze.

<h1> Febreze </h1>
<p class="blocktext">
	Febreze is the miracle of engineering that creates freshness in your homes, cars, and sock drawers. <br/> For some subjects, it creates the illusion and feeling of being outside when in reality he or she has not left the house or car in days.
</p>

<h2> How is this possible? </h2>
<p>
	Scientists in the fast growing field of scent production have manufactured a chemical that, when sprayed onto the origin of odor, becomes S.W.A.G.G., which stands for Switftly Wafting Airborne Germicidal Gasiform. This main ingredient in Febreze creates the magical freshness that engulfs the previous stank.
</p>

<h3> 
	However, due to the wide range of possible applications of Febreze and its easy accessibility, some may find themselves confused as to the situations in which Febreze's magical powers can used in a socially acceptable manner. 
</h3>

<p>Luckily, this dilemma has been anticipated by the the committee for safe scent usage and they have created a table specifically for those stuck in such situations.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Situation</b></td>
		<td><b>Febreze it?</b></td>
		<td><b>Explanation/Alternate Solution</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Just had a party, and now the flat smells like pizza</td>
		<td>Sure!</td>
		<td>For better results remove all empty pizza boxes first.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Forgot to use dryer sheets?</td>
		<td>Of course!</td>
		<td>That's why there is a "fresh linen" scent of Febreze.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Parents visiting?</td>
		<td>Absolutely.</td>
		<td>Don't miss a single spot, especially not the shoe rack.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Leftover evidence of an accidental recreation of "Weekend at Bernie's"?</td>
		<td>You probably should look for stronger options</td>
		<td>The number for emergency services in the US is 911. If that isn't an option, you might want to hide the body before the neighbors find out.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Somebody has a stinky personality?</td>
		<td>Sorry, Febreze will not clean someone's attitude</td>
		<td>However, Febreze to the face and eyes will still sting and can still be used if the person comes near you.</td>
	</tr>
